{\large\textbf{Data}} \\\

For our consultation we consider the following predictors from the full data set:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $ PREDDEG =$ predominant degree type awarded
\item $ CCBASIC =$ type of school
\item $ MENONLY =$ male only
\item $ CURROPER =$ currently operating school?
\item $ FEMALE =$ number of female attendants
\item $ UGDS\_WOMEN =$ number of female attendants pursuing a degree
\item $ MN\_EARN\_WNE\_MALE0\_P6 =$ Mean earnings of female students working and not enrolled 6 years after entry
\item $ SATMT75 =$ number of SAT math scores at 75th percentile
\item $ SATMTMID =$ median SAT math score
\item $ ACTMT75 =$ number of ACT math scores at 75th percentile
\item $ ACTMTMID =$ median ACT math score
\item $ PCIP26 =$ \# Science type degree
\item $ PCIP29 =$ \# Science type degree
\item $ PCIP41 =$ \# Science type degree
\item $ PCIP27 =$ \# Math degrees
\item $ PCIP14 =$ \# Engineering type degree
\item $ PCIP15 =$ \# Engineering type degree
\item $ FEMALE\_YR4\_N =$ \# females to graduate in 4 years from the school
\item $ FEMALE\_YR6\_N =$ \# females to graduate in 6 years from the school
\item $ COUNT\_WNE\_MALE0\_P6 =$ Number of female students working and not enrolled 6 years after entry
\end{enumerate}

These predictors will be used to create a regression model predicting and, ultimately, create a score for each school.
