{\large\textbf{Abstract}} \\\

In this paper we will consider the data provided in \href{https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data}{collegescorecard.ed.gov} to consult on the following issue:
\begin{center}
\emph{
"The CEO of a biotech startup is looking for candidates. She is interested in diversifying the workforce in regards to women in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math). Where should the startup focus their recruitment and outreach for maximum impact?"
}
\end{center}
To ensure we use the newest data on recent college graduates we will only consider the most recent datafiles, ignoring older data. Next we will create a scoring system to rank colleges based on where we believe our client will have the most success in recruiting top tier female STEM majors.
